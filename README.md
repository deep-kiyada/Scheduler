# Scheduler
The Scheduler is a 1st rank winner web application for Students and Faculties to schedule their own routine. It contains an Assignment portal, Announcement portal, Proxy lectures management for faculties, Notes, Weekly time-table, Calendar, and many more.

Run Server and load master-st.html

Project is mainly distributed in 3 parts:
-Student (Folder name 'st')
